title: "Project 4 - Stock Price Prediction"
excerpt: "Prediction of stock market performance is one of the most difficult things to do. There are so many factors involved in the prediction â€“ physical factors vs. physhological, rational and irrational behavior, etc. All these aspects combine to make share prices instable and very difficult to predict with a high degree of accuracy. Stock price forecast is the most crucial component for investors and companies to predict future revenues and any possible negative earnings. The essence of the stock market investments involves high risk and high profits; thus, it is a source of attraction to many businesses, investors and economists."
