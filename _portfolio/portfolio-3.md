title: "[Project 3 - Air Travel Safety](https://tdavidna.github.io/airsafetyblogpost/fastpages/jupyter/2021/10/21/DSC64043.html)"
excerpt: "Driving is more dangerous, with more than 5 million accidents compared to 20 accidents in flying. As per the comparison motor vehicle accident to be 1 in 98 for a lifetime. For air and space transport, the odds were 1 in 7K for a lifetime. Due to perception, it may feel that flying is more dangerous, but the fact is different. Another reason is plane crashes are catastrophic like killing more people at once. Other accidents happen every day and spread the loss over time, making their combined effects less noticeable."
