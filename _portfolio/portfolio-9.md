excerpt: "Exploratory Data Analysis is applied to explore the data and condense the key insights. It will give the basic understanding of the data, itâ€™s distribution, null values and much more. You can either explore data using graphs or through some python functions. Univariate and Bivariate are the two types of data analysis. In the univariate, you will be analyzing a single attribute.
