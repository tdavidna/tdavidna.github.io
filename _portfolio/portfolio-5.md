title: "[Project 5 - Data Visualization using Python Charts] (https://github.com/tdavidna/DSC680/blob/main/3.2_Exercise.ipynb)"
excerpt: "Visualization is very clear in the bar chart, for each designation / position it is easy to identify the corresponding salary. Comparatively other charts like Line and Pie are not that clear for this sample data analysis. Bar charts are flexible and use vertical or horizontal bars to represent data along both an x-axis and a y-axis visually. Bar chart use bars of different lengths to represent data and each bar represents one value. Bar charts are easy to interpret, and there is a very clear relationship between size and value that allows easy comparison."
