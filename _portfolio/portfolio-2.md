excerpt: "Housing market trends and forecasts shows an extraordinarily strong real estate market, with strong housing demand in every part of the country. The improved economy and millennials entering their peak home buying years are fueling a residential housing boom. Along with this, low mortgage rates, combined with an increase in working from home because of the pandemic, have spurred a surge in housing demand, particularly in lower-density suburbs. In 2020, more existing homes were sold than in any other years since 2006."
